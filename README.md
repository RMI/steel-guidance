# RMI Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance
This repository holds RMI's Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance, along with licensing and related documents.

RMI's Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance consists of accounting guidance, in the form of PDF file, as well as a Pathfinder Network Data Model Extension The accounting guidance was launched in September of 2022--you can read the blog post [here](https://rmi.org/knowing-the-emissions-of-your-steel-supply-chain/) and press release [here](https://rmi.org/press-release/rmi-releases-guidance-to-cut-steel-industrys-climate-threat/).

## Product Level Accounting Guidance
RMI's Steel GHG Emissions Reporting Guidance can be found [here:](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/steel_emissions_reporting_guidance.pdf)

This guidance was authored by [RMI](https://rmi.org/) in collaboration with the [World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)](https://www.wbcsd.org/) and its [Automotive Partnership for Carbon Transparency (A-PACT)](https://www.wbcsd.org/Pathways/Transport-Mobility/News/Leading-manufacturers-support-move-towards-better-emissions-measurement-for-the-automotive-industry) initiative.

### Key Principles
There are four key requirements for reporting steel sector emissions using this Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance:

#### 1. Use of primary data
As much as possible, emissions calculations should be based on first-hand information from
actors in the supply chain.

#### 2. Create a boundary for comparison
Companies should report emissions against a fixed boundary (i.e., a consistent
set of processes) to enable comparability between disclosures.

#### 3. Measurement made for markets
Ensure calculation and reporting decisions provide the transparency necessary to
enable the development of a market for low-embodied-emissions products.

### Fixed System Boundary
The fixed system boundary defines all the process steps from which emissions need to be reported irrespective of the steel companiesâ€™ ownership structure. This approach solves two key issues:

#### Emissions disclosure at the corporate level will vary depending on the degree of vertical integration
#### Scope 1, 2, and 3 will likely become more fluid overtime, further limiting comparability

For more information on the Fixed System Boundary, see section 2.2 of the [accounting guidance](https://github.com/RMI/steel-guidance/blob/main/RMI%20Horizon%20Zero%20Steel%20Guidance.pdf)

## Pathfinder Network Data Model Extension
In addition to the Product Level Accounting Guidance, this repository contains supporting documents for a [Pathfinder Network](https://www.carbon-transparency.com/) Data Model Extension for Steel, which is designed to be used in concert with RMI's Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance.

The Pathfinder Data Model is designed to enable the use of machine-readable sharing of product level information. Extensions to the model allow for sector specific information to be added to the data model. sTechnical guidance on the Pathfinder Network data model can be found [here.](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2/)

### Key Terms
Some key terms for understanding the data model extension:

#### Abatement Technology
  A qualitative label of the techology used to reduce emissions in the steel and aluminum supply chains. For more information, please refer to the Sec 3.4 [Abatement Technology] section of RMI's [Steel GHG Emissions Reporting Guidance](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/steel_emissions_reporting_guidance.pdf)

#### Benchmarking
  Emissions associated with all relevant processes to either crude steel or hot-rolled product. For more information see Sec 2.3 of RMI's [Steel GHG Emissions Reportings Guidance.](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/steel_emissions_reporting_guidance.pdf)
  
#### Full Boundary
  Emissions associated with all relevant processes from cradle to gate. For more information see Sec 2.2 Fixed System Boundary of RMI's [Steel GHG Emissions Reportings Guidance.](https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/steel_emissions_reporting_guidance.pdf)
