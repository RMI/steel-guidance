# RMI Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance

This repository holds RMI's Steel Emissions Reporting Guidance, along with licensing and related documents. The guidance was launched in September of 2022--you can read the blog post [here](https://rmi.org/knowing-the-emissions-of-your-steel-supply-chain/) and press release [here](https://rmi.org/press-release/rmi-releases-guidance-to-cut-steel-industrys-climate-threat/).

The guidance was authored by [RMI](https://rmi.org/) in collaboration with the [World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)](https://www.wbcsd.org/) and its [Automotive Partnership for Carbon Transparency (A-PACT)](https://www.wbcsd.org/Pathways/Transport-Mobility/News/Leading-manufacturers-support-move-towards-better-emissions-measurement-for-the-automotive-industry) initiative.
